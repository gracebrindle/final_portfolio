            <h2>Carleton College</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.coursicle.com/carleton/courses/HIST/200/">Historians for Hire</a> is a public history course at Carleton College that connects undergraduate students with community partners in Northfield, Minnesota to complete a historical research project.
                Students engage in discussions surrounding museums and history education throughout the course while also gaining hands-on experience in archival research, exhibit building, collaboration, and
                community service.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Winter 2021, I worked with a local historian, Sarah Entenmann, to conduct oral history interviews of African-American alumni from the 1970s. The purpose of the project was to document the experiences
                and feelings of Carleton’s earliest cohort of Black students, particularly those that received scholarships through the Rockefeller Grant. In doing so, we sought to restore Black voices to the archives,
                assess Carleton’s degree of success in supporting Black students, and identify areas of improvement for the future.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p class="goal">
                Conduct oral history interviews and archival research to understand the experience of Black students at Carleton College
                during the late 60s and early 70s
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                The majority of this process consisted of archival research. I sifted through records of Carleton’s official school newspaper, The Carletonian, to find stories relating to the Rockefeller Grant and the
                Black experience at Carleton during the 70s. I also visited the Carleton College archives where I read through hundreds of documents related to the Rockefeller Grant and Carleton’s initiative to recruit students
                of color during the 60s and 70s.
            </p>
            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
                Following my research, I completed an <a href="https://archivedb.carleton.edu/index.php?p=digitallibrary/digitalcontent&id=87823&q=clifford">oral history interview with Clifford Clark</a>,
                a professor at Carleton who helped many of the Rockefeller Grant recipients.
