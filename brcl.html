            <h2>Big Rapids Community Library</h2>
            <p>
                Big Rapids Community Library (BRCL) is a small public library in Big Rapids, Michigan that serves approximately
                10,000 residents. The mission of the library is to encourage literacy by sharing resources and experiences
                that nurture curiosity, education, and growth to create a connected and thriving community.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of a course on contextual inquiry and consulting, I worked with Big Rapids
                Community Library to improve their room reservation system. I completed
                a background research report and worked with a team of four peers to create an interview protocol. My team completed
                six interviews with various library staff
                members and recorded affinity notes. We then constructed an affinity wall of over 150 notes to analyze our
                data and draw conclusions.
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p class="goal">
                Identify tools and practices to simplify the library's room reservation system and make it more accessible to patrons and staff
            </p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                For the first part of the process, I completed a background research report to understand the room reservation systems in place at other
                libraries. My goal was to study the common needs of libraries and the advantages and disadvantages of each online room reservation system. I
                conducted research using academic resources, such as databases and journals, to identify the shared challenges and objectives of libraries in
                establishing a room reservation system.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the next stage, my team and I interviewed several members of the library staff to understand the pain points in using the
                current library room reservation system. We spoke with six staff members with a wide range of roles to assess how the room reservation
                system worked and how it could be improved. During this process, we completed interpretation sessions to build affinity notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon conclusion of the interview process, we built an affinity wall using our notes to identify larger trends in our
                data and understand the root of the issue. We discovered that the room reservation system was very decentralized and contained
                some redundant processes, which sparked confusion among library staff and resulted in double bookings.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the final part of our project, we used our affinity wall to inform our recommendations for the library on a new and
                improved room reservation system.
            </p>
