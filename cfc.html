            <h2>Westfield Arts Collective</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, I worked with a local art collective to create a website for their new community space. I began by meeting with the organization to understand
                their mission and needs. As a new organization, the Westfield Arts Collective was still in the process of developing their plan for the space and wanted a high degree
                of flexibility for the website. Their primary needs for the website were to inform community members and increase awareness, collect donations, and gather volunteer
                information.
            </p>


            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p class="goal">
                Raise awareness of a new non-profit organization in Westfield by creating a public website

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                After consulting with the organization, we decided that Wix would be the best platform for building the website. I began this process by outlining the pages and
                information architecture of the website. Once I established a structure that met the user's needs, I began to flesh out the content of the website. I chose a color scheme that
                matched the colors of the organization's logo and picked a minimalist sans-serif font for accessibility. I then added textual content and images using the organization's
                business plans and branding documents as a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once these basic elements of the site were created, I focused on increasing the functionality of the site. I created a form to capture data from users who were
                interested in volunteering and integrated a PayPal donation form for those who wished to donate. I also optimized the website for search engines and accessibility,
                ensuring there was alternative text and sufficient color contrast on every page.
